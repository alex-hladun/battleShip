# battleShip
A battleship game for browser!

This project uses HTML, CSS, JS, and jQuery with plans to set up Express on the back-end. It has features such as differing computer level, ship placement, and a couple of other features. The game works, but there are still a couple of features I would like to add when I have some more time.

# Road map / bugs

* The add/remove ship, shots per turn, and play online with friend features need to be implemented. 

* Game may crash if board is set too small. Need to add constraints to make sure this isn't possible.

* Set max size for game board setting. 

* Set up a server with express to serve the game and allow players to play against each other. 

* Set up a leaderboard which shows users records against global records for each CPU difficulty. 

* Add the ability to replay a game from the leaderboard.

* Minor issue where column labels are off-center.

* A glitch where you can't rotate the first ship after starting a new game.

* Would like to add some more exciting CSS animation / transitions.
